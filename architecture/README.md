### Architecture Diagrams

We want to have clean and understandable architecture. For this porpoise we're going to maintain diagrams in the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/).
You can find each layer of the model at the corresponding L# folder.

_Note that L3 and L4 are too dev specific and don't make sense beforehand, especially if they are not adding value. The best practise would be to add them while developing the applications themselves. This process could even be automated (generating the diagrams from code)_
