# InstaPic Design
Instagram-like application that connects all users in the network.
This repository includes all architectural documents and design decisions related to the making of InstaPic.

## Overview
InstaPic is a Photo shearing Social Network. The web and mobile apps allow users to upload and view their pictures and view the pictures of every other user in the network chronologically - like a group chat, but with pictures ;)

### Structure
This repository contains:

1. System architecture - We will keep an overview of the architecture structured following the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/)

1. Design decisions - We will keep a record of the architectural decisions under the `decisions` folder, following the format [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
