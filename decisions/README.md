### Architectural Decision records

We want to store all the architectural decisions maid in the process so that new people can onboard quicker, see why certain decisions were maid, and see what other decisions were evaluated and why were they rejected.
For this porpoise we are going to use the [lightweight framework described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
